- How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

  Testing plays an important role in software development. It is through testing that potential issues are identified prior to deploying to production. Testing provides developers a means to output quality code. There is a saying that I live by and it is "Garbage in...garbage out." This reminds me that I'm responsible for the end product. Testing is a tool to help me build quality and secure applications. 

- How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

  One of the things I picked up from this course is the importance of collecting requirements. After collecting the requirements it is important to break down those requirements into smaller tasks that are easy to code and incrementally test. There should never be any ambiguity around what the user wants you to build. If there is, ask questions and never assume. I also try to look for keywords that help me to understand what kind of functionality needs to be incorporated. Keywords, I look for often are verbs such as ADD, CREATE, DELETE. Also being able to identify when certain conditions must be met in order for something to ocurr is a good way to break down requirements into functional and non-functional components. 
  
- How do I approach designing software?

  I always take an agile approach to software development. I feel that through iterative development, a developer can focus on smaller chunks and be more focused on the deliverables for that sprint. Testing should also be part of that process. Another adage that I like to live by is "Test early and Test often." Implementing the agile methodology in my projects allows me to do that and produce quality code while removing ambiguity and mitigating issues right from the start of the start.
